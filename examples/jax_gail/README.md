## GAIL Imitation Learning Example

This example demonstrates training a GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning) agent on the Unitree H1 robot to mimic a dataset of human running. It serves as a minimal showcase of the GAIL algorithm and is **not** intended to produce state-of-the-art results.

### üöÄ Training

To train the agent, run:

```bash
python experiment.py
```

This command will:

- Train the GAIL agent on the Unitree H1 robot for 75 million steps (approximately 7-10 minutes on an RTX 3080 Ti).
- Save the trained agent (as `GAILJax_saved.pkl` in the `outputs` folder).
- Perform a final rendering of the trained policy.
- Save a video of the rendering to the `LocoMuJoCo_recordings/` directory.
- Upload the video to Weights & Biases (WandB) for further analysis (check the command line logs for details).

### üìà Evaluation

To evaluate the trained agent, run:

```bash
python eval.py --path path/to/agent_file
```

If you'd like to evaluate the agent using MuJoCo (instead of Mjx), run:

```bash
python eval.py --path path/to/agent_file --use_mujoco
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Evaluating with MuJoCo may not yield results as robust as with Mjx due to simulator differences. For reliable policy transfer between the two, consider applying domain randomization techniques.
