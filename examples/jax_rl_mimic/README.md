## DeepMimic Imitation Learning Example

This example demonstrates training a PPO agent with a DeepMimic reward on the Unitree H1 robot to mimic a dataset of 
human walking in different directions.

This example will use the `GoalTrajMimic` as a goal vector including positions, orientations, and velocities of the 
site positions and joint positions and velocities to match from the expert dataset. The defined reward function in 
the configuration is`MimicReward`, which corresponds to a DeepMimic style reward. The trained agent 
can walk in various directions and rotate around its z-axis at the end of training.

### üöÄ Training

To train the agent, run:

```bash
python experiment.py
```

This command will:

- Train the PPO agent on the Unitree H1 robot for 300 million steps (approximately 36 minutes on an RTX 3080 Ti).
- Save the trained agent (as `GAILJax_saved.pkl` in the `outputs` folder).
- Perform a final rendering of the trained policy.
- Save a video of the rendering to the `LocoMuJoCo_recordings/` directory.
- Upload the video to Weights & Biases (WandB) for further analysis (check the command line logs for details).


#### Validation Loop During Training

Throughout training, the agent will be evaluated using various trajectory-based metrics, including 
Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and discrete Fr√©chet distance. These metrics will be 
computed on different entities such as joint positions, joint velocities, and site positions and orientations. 
All results will be logged to Weights & Biases (WandB).

### üìà Evaluation

To evaluate the trained agent, run:

```bash
python eval.py --path path/to/agent_file
```

If you'd like to evaluate the agent using MuJoCo (instead of Mjx), run:

```bash
python eval.py --path path/to/agent_file --use_mujoco
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Evaluating with MuJoCo may not yield results as robust as with Mjx due to simulator differences. For reliable policy transfer between the two, consider applying domain randomization techniques.
